# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

##CONVERTING REACT APP INTO PWA

ADD MANIFEST.json in public like below

{
  "short_name": "React App",
  "name": "Create React App Sample",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}

* Customize the values for each field as appropriate for our need.

    Add a Service Worker:

    Install the workbox-cli package: npm install --save-dev workbox-cli.
    Run the following command in your project directory: npx workbox wizard.
    Follow the prompts to generate a Service Worker file and configure caching for your app's assets.
    Register the Service Worker in your React app's entry point, usually index.js, like this:


    in npx workbox wizard i saved all configuration in root directory by giving the project location in my case its /home/astra/Desktop/Giftly-Frontend-app

    if you need to get the path of project open terminal and enter pwd   it will show the current working directory

    
 
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
      .then(registration => {
        console.log('Service worker registered:', registration);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Service worker registration failed:', error);
      });
  });
}

    Implement caching:

    Use the Workbox-generated Service Worker file to configure caching for your app's assets.
    For example, to cache all CSS files, add the following code to the Service Worker file:

    workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  /\.(?:css)$/,
  new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst()
);

    Add an "Add to Home Screen" prompt:

    Add the following code to the <head> section of your app's HTML file:


    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black">
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">

Customize the values for apple-mobile-web-app-capable and apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style as appropriate for your app.# testt
